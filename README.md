There is a map represented as a graph which has an articulation point that divides the graph into two parts while one of the parts described as directed and the other part described as undirected
-> Project's aim is finding the shortest path between two nodes in the directed part of the graph and finding the minimum spanning tree on the undirected part of the graph
-> Dijkstra's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm are used
